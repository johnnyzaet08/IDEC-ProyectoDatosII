# C++ Sockets - Simple server and client chat (linux)

A simple socket programming which creates a connection between two terminals on linux. This was my second semester final project, so I thought I'll share with you.

# Requirements

1. Ubuntu 12.0 LTS or higher
2. G++ compiler for Ubuntu
3. A text editor

# Compilation

1. Compile the server.cpp file first and then the client.cpp file.
2. To send a message, run your client.cpp and type "your-message *" *Notice that you need to add an asterisk at the end of each sentence to send a message.
3. Same goes for server.cpp

# Limitations

This code is limited to one client only. There is only one-to-one connection. To have multiple connections you need to know about threading.
